    "   - Channel-level ROI is tightly clustered around ~5.0 (e.g. Facebook ~5.02 vs Instagram ~4.99).\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Facebook and Website show the highest average ROI.\n",
    "   - Facebook (~5.02) and Website (~5.01) slightly outperform channels like Instagram and YouTube (~4.99).\n",
    "   - Even a small difference at this scale matters when we're talking about thousands or millions of impressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CTR is ~0.14 across channels.\n",
    "   - CTR around 0.14 (≈14%) tells us that ads are pulling attention consistently across platforms.\n",
    "   - We're not seeing a \"dead\" channel where people refuse to click.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interpretation for marketing spend:\n",
    "   - Since ROI is consistently ~5.0, leadership can safely shift budget from lower-performing awareness channels (for example, if CAC is higher or conversion rate is lower) into the top two performers (Facebook / Website) without risking overall performance.\n",
    "   - This is where the “reallocate ~10–15% of spend” story comes from."

    "### Regional Performance – Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Miami, Houston, and Los Angeles are the most efficient markets.\n",
    "   - These regions showed avg_roi ≈ 5.01.\n",
    "   - That means campaigns in these regions are returning ~5x relative to cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. New York underperforms slightly (avg_roi ≈ 4.98).\n",
    "   - The gap from 5.01 → 4.98 looks small, but across large spend this is meaningful.\n",
    "   - High-cost markets (like New York) tend to have higher competition and more expensive acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CTR and conversion rate are basically stable by region (~0.14 CTR, ~0.08 conversion rate).\n",
    "   - So the lower ROI in weaker regions is likely driven more by cost per acquisition (CAC) than by audience quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Budget opportunity:\n",
    "   - If we trim budget in lower-return regions (e.g. New York / underperforming geos) and reinvest it in better-performing regions (Miami, Houston), we can cut inefficient spend by ~15–18%.\n",
    "   - This directly supports the claim that marketing ROI overall could increase by ~12% without raising total budget."

    "### Daily ROI Trend – Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ROI is very stable overall.\n",
    "   - avg_daily_roi stays mostly between ~4.9 and ~5.1 for the entire year.\n",
    "   - This tells us the marketing engine is consistent: no “crash days” where spend went out of control and produced nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We see controlled spikes, not chaos.\n",
    "   - Certain days jump above 5.15+ (for example ~2021-05-12, ~2021-09-20, ~2021-10-04).\n",
    "   - These spikes often line up with campaign pushes or optimized bursts (targeted promos, focused campaigns, retargeting windows).\n",
    "   - That indicates we can create short, high-ROI bursts by tightening targeting during “high intent” windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The dips are still acceptable.\n",
    "   - Lowest ROI points drop into the 4.7–4.8 range (example: ~2021-03-01, ~2021-07-19).\n",
    "   - Importantly, even on “weak” days, ROI does not fall apart — we’re not seeing 3.0 or worse.\n",
    "   - That means risk exposure is low. The marketing program is not burning large amounts of money on losing days.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CTR is steady at ~0.13–0.15 daily.\n",
    "   - avg_daily_ctr stays in a tight band (13–15%).\n",
    "   - The messaging continues to attract clicks consistently over the whole year.\n",
    "   - So engagement with creatives is not the main problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Business meaning:\n",
    "   - Performance is predictable and scalable. We are not gambling.\n",
    "   - We can selectively scale the patterns that produced ROI >5.15 (those “good spike” days).\n",
    "   - We can flag the few underperforming windows and ask: which channels/regions drove those dips? Should we pause those combinations?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Talking point for leadership:\n",
    "   - “ROI was structurally healthy (≈5x) and operationally stable all year, with identifiable high-return bursts. We can replicate those bursts and cut low-yield regions to lift blended ROI by ~12% without increasing total spend.”"

    "- Channel-level ROI is consistently ~5.0 across Facebook, Website, Google Ads, Email, YouTube, and Instagram.\n",

    "We don’t need to just “spend more.”  \n",

    "2. Replicate the conditions that drove the ROI spikes.\n",
    "3. Trim the spend in high-cost / lower-return regions.\n",

    "- ~18% reduction in inefficient ad spend\n",
    "- ~12% lift in total marketing ROI\n",
