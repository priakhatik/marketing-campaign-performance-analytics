## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Handled missing values and inconsistent formats.  
- Standardized categorical variables and normalized continuous features.  
- Derived new fields such as `TotalSpend`, `CampaignSuccessRate`, and `CustomerLifetimeValue`.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified correlations between **age, income, and campaign response rates**.  
- Visualized engagement levels across different **marketing channels (email, social, web)**.  
- Analyzed purchase frequency, deal usage, and customer retention trends.  

### 3. Campaign Performance Metrics
- Calculated:  
  - **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**  
  - **Conversion Rate (CVR)**  
  - **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**  
  - **Return on Investment (ROI)**  
- Compared performance across **channels, age groups, and spending levels**.  

### 4. Visualization & Reporting
Created a **Tableau dashboard** featuring:
- Campaign ROI by Channel  
- Top 5 Performing Segments  
- Conversion Funnel (Awareness → Engagement → Purchase)  
- Customer Retention and Lifetime Value  

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Email campaigns produced the **highest ROI (18%)** and strongest engagement.  
- Social media generated high reach but lower conversion efficiency.  
- Customers aged **30–45** with **mid-to-high income** showed the best response rates.  
- Optimizing cross-channel frequency led to a potential **reduction of wasted ad spend by ~18%**.  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate **machine learning** to predict campaign success probability.  
- Automate ROI reporting through **Airflow** or **Power BI Dataflows**.  
- Perform **A/B testing** using statistical methods to validate creative impact.  
- Extend analysis to **lifetime value forecasting** and **churn prediction**.
